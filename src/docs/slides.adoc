== The mission

* Provide a means for individual volunteers to be sheltered from legal suits directed at the Foundation’s project
* Protect the ‘Apache’ brand, as applied to its software products, from being abused by other organizations
* Provide legal and technical infrastructure for open source software development and to perform appropriate oversight of such software

* provide software for the public good


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Legal protection
* Brand protection
* Get out of your way so that you can develop software

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
== Vision

The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects. The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field. We consider ourselves not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather a community of developers and users.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Consensus-based development - community-created
High quality software - Code should be exceptional
--

== Legal Structure

* Member-based corporation - individuals, not companies, can be members
* Members nominate and elect new members
* Members elect a board - 9 seats
* Annual members meetings via IRC. Board meets monthly.
* Each PMC has a Chair - eyes and ears of the board (oversight only)

NOTE: The ASF is a legal entity - a non-profit - and must conduct itself according to certain laws and bylaws.

== *How does it work*

The Apache Way

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== The Apache Way ...

* A method of developing software
* A method of running communities
* A method of governing a Foundation

== *The Apache Way* - Why the ASF Works

* Meritocracy
* Transparency
* Community

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Our approach is based on three pillars, often referred to as “The Apache Way”:

Meritocracy - Individuals come to our projects as individuals, and grow the community’s trust and appreciation by what they do and how they do it.

Transparency - Our projects are developed and evolved in the open, ensuring that everyone that wants to contribute is able to.

Community - We believe that great software is an emergent property of great communities, and therefore place community health over all else.
--

== The Results

* Vendor Neutrality
* Diversity
* Trusted
* Safe

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Our focus on Meritocracy, Transparency and Community results in:

Vendor Neutrality - We are a natural meeting place for competitors to collaborate together on shared goals.
Diversity - Our flexible model of governance lets projects evolve independently, yet ensures they remain independent and diverse communities.
Trusted - We are trusted by organizations around the globe to serve as a home for their more important software projects.
Safe - Our governance model, intellectual property processes and licensing framework provide a safe environment for contributors and users alike.

== Merit

image::stairs.png[Merit, width="300", float="right", align="center"]

* Any constructive contribution earns merit
* Not just code
* Evangelism
* Bug reports and triage
* Testing
* Documentation
* Design feedback
* User support
* Etc.


//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//[data-background="images/cc/codecentric-green-background-16x9.png"]
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Community > Code

* Since we are all volunteers, people’s time and interests change
* A healthy community is “warm and inviting” and encourages a continued influx of developers as others leave
* Poisonous people/communities turn people off, and the project will die
* End result - better code, long-term code

[NOTE.speaker]
--
One of our sayings is "Community > Code", which is shorthand for saying that the community actually matters more than
the code itself. A sustainable community leads to code you can depend on, but good code, all by itself, isn't sustainable,
because the world changes around you.

//[data-background="images/dice.png"]
== Consensus-based decisions

image::dice.png[Dice]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
voting
+1 - yes
+0 - no real comment
-1 - veto
Also, -0, -0.5, +0.5, etc... to indicate non-binding opinions
--

== Collaborative Development

* Code is developed by the community
* Voting ensures at least 3 active developers
* Time requirement on votes ensures representation across many timezones
* Development done online and on-list - If it didn’t happen on-list, it didn’t happen

[NOTE.speaker]
--
If you don't have enough people to vote on releases, then that's a leading indicator
that something is seriously wrong with the project, and something needs to change.
--

== If it didn't happen on the mailing list ...

* All decisions must be done in the open
* Private discussions happen - bring it back to the list!
* Provide time for feedback from those that weren't there

== Ways to Contribute

* Documentation, Tutorials and Examples
* Helping others with queries and questions
* Issue / bug tracker triage
* Testing new fixes, helping reproduce problems

== Ways to Contribute

* Bug Fixes and New Features
* Writing add-ons and extensions
* Mentoring, volunteering for the Foundation
* Sponsorship

== How companies can contribute

* You can allow your employees to participate
* You can sponsor the foundation financially
* You can donate your useful code to the foundation, so the whole world can benefit

[NOTE.speaker]
--
No corporate memberships. You are not buying influence.
